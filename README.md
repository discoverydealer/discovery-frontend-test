# Simple Timer

You will create a basic timer. This timer will show time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. The format will be mm:ss:mss, like 01:30:500. It starts at 00:00:000.

### Features:

- Start Button: When you click this, the timer starts counting.
- Pause Button: This stops the timer. You can press start again to continue from where you stopped.
- Reset Button: This sets the timer back to 00:00:000. It works even if the timer is running.
- the minutes should have no limit

### Tips:

- The milliseconds can work using 100ms as interval.
